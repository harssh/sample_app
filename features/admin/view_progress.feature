Feature: View Progress

As the owner of the site
I want to know how many visitors have requested accounts
so I can know account requests


Scenario: Administrator views list of users

Given I request an account with valid user data
And I am logged in as an administrator
When I visit the users page
Then I should see a list of users

Scenario: User cannot view list of users

Given I am logged in
When I visit the users page
Then I should see an access denied message
